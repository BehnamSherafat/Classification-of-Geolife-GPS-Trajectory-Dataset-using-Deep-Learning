# Classification-of-Geolife-GPS-Trajectory-Dataset-using-Deep-Learning
several deep learning models are implemented to evaluate the performance on classifying the user labels. The deep learning models used are 1-layer Fully-Connected, 2-layer Fully-Connected, 1-layer Convolutional, and 2-layer convolutional. Moreover, to better analyses the performance of our model, several machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Adaboost are used to compare their results with our models
