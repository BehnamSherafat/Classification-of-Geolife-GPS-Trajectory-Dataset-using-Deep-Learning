# Classification-of-Geolife-GPS-Trajectory-Dataset-using-Deep-Learning
Several deep learning models are implemented to evaluate the performance on classifying the user labels. The deep learning models used are 1-layer Fully-Connected, 2-layer Fully-Connected, 1-layer Convolutional, and 2-layer convolutional. Moreover, to better analyses the performance of our model, several machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Adaboost are used to compare their results with our models

In this report, a GPS trajectory dataset is utilized to classify the user labels using binary and multiple classification deep learning model. This dataset contains the sequences of latitude, longitude, and altitude of the 182 users’ locations. To efficiently develop the model, first, a novel pre-processing algorithm is used to reduce the dimension of the dataset. This method significantly decreases the computational time of the classification model and does minimum impact on the accuracies.

## Pre-processing
Different types of pre-processing methods are applied on the dataset to remove the outliers and reduce the dimension of the dataset which are as follows:
	# Outlier Removal: It is inevitable that there are humans stay still in some places for a long time. We have removed the tracjectories without having a real movement, i.e., if C_0,C_1,...,C_n be the waypoints of the trajectory and C_0≈ C_1≈ ...≈ C_n, then we will remove these trajectories.
	# Remove trajectories with many points: Sometimes, trajectories with too many waypoints can cause computational issues. For instance, we can set an upper bound for waypoints like 1000. However, we do not think it would be necessary. A lower bound on the number of waypoints can be used for computational issues as well.
  Dimension reduction: In this project, we have used a novel data mapping from our trajectory data to R^20, R^50, and R^250 under two different feature mappings [1]. Landmarks employed for creating these datasets are stored in Landmarks folder in csv format. The first one with size 20 is hand-picked from near the mean and median of waypoints of the trajectories. The second one with size 50 is handpicked from a map visualization of all trajectories in such a way that they are chosen to be near to a group of trajectories. The last one with size 250 is constructed by 200 gridding points plus previously chosen 50 points from the map.

2.2. Classification
The mapped data is used for classifying the user label. In this project, several deep learning models are implemented to evaluate the performance on classifying the user labels. The deep learning models used are 1-layer Fully-Connected, 2-layer Fully-Connected, 1-layer Convolutional, and 2-layer convolutional.
Moreover, to better analyses the performance of our model, several machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Adaboost are used to compare their results with our models. 

3. Case Study and Results
The GPS trajectory dataset was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by 182 users in a period of over five years (from April 2007 to August 2012) [2,3,4]. A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of 1,292,951kilometers and a total duration of 50,176 hours. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers and GPS-phones, and have a variety of sampling rates. 91.5 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5 seconds or every 5~10 meters per point.
This dataset recoded a broad range of users’ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. This trajectory dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.
Although this dataset is wildly distributed in over 30 cities of China and even in some cities located in the USA and Europe, the majority of the data was created in Beijing, China. Figure 1 plots the distribution (heat map) of this dataset in Beijing. The figures standing on the right side of the heat bar denote the number of points generated in a location.
